# NetworkTables-CSharp
A bare-bones implementation of NT4 for C#. Designed for unity but does not rely on it. 

> Disclaimer: This is by no means a complete implementation of the protocol and several methods are ignored as of now. This package may or may not be updated in the future and may or may not be supported.

## Installation

> Note: Unity users will need to install [NuGetForUnity](https://github.com/GlitchEnzo/NuGetForUnity)

You will need the following NuGet packages:
- [Newtonsoft.Json](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Newtonsoft.Json)
- [WebSocketSharp](https://www.nuget.org/packages/WebSocketSharp)
- [MessagePack](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MessagePack)

For now, clone this repository into your project.

<sup>In the future, NetworkTables-CSharp may be made into a NuGet package.<sup>
